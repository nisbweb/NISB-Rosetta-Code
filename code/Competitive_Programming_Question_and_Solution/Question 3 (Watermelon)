Let's call a sequence good if the sum of all its elements is 0.

You have a sequence of integers A1,A2,…,AN. You may perform any number of operations on this sequence (including zero). In one operation, you should choose a valid index i and decrease Ai by i. Can you make the sequence good using these operations?

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to make the given sequence good or "NO" if it is impossible.

Constraints
1≤T≤1,000
1≤N≤10
|Ai|≤100 for each valid i
