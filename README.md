## Rosetta Code :
This is a beginner-friendly project to help you get started with your hacktoberfest. This repository is dedicated to help beginners step up and join hands with the open source community. Feel free to start contributing. There are no wrong contributions. If you don't know where to start, feel free to watch the videos linked below, and read the contribution rules. Happy hacking !! By watching the video you will understand better about the working of hacktoberfest and how one will be able to create pull requests. (P.S: Star and share this repository, if you had fun!)

## Rules :
- You are allowed to make pull requests that break the rules. We just won't merge it ;).
- Do NOT add any build steps e.g npm install,pip install, cargo install etc.
- Do NOT import any libraries apart from the ones available in the standard library for that language.
- Do NOT make duplicates of the same code in the same language. Feel free to switch up the language if you wish to do so.
- Do NOT remove Videos, Rules, FAQ, or any other helpful content.
- Styling/code can be pretty, ugly or stupid, big or small as long as it works.
- Add your details to the contributors.json file.
- Try to keep pull requests small to minimize merge conflicts.
- Do NOT change anything in index.js, .github/workflows/main.yaml
- Do NOT edit README.md or main.mustache . Adding your data to contributers.json will add you as a contributer
- Write proper commit messages and comment wherever necessary
- Organize your code in the proper directory.
- No Hello world code.
- Feel free to add more category folders but if one already exists, do NOT create another one.
- Keep all your code in the /code folder in the proper directories.
- In line with Hacktoberfest value #2 (Quantity is fun, quality is key), we have provided examples of pull requests that we consider to be low-quality contributions (which we discourage).
  - Pull requests that are automated (e.g. scripted opening pull requests to remove whitespace/fix typos/optimize images).
  - Pull requests that are disruptive (e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a pull request).
  - Pull requests that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping.
  - Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your pull request count for October ( One PR to fix whitespace is fine, 5 are not ).
